   On Becoming Clueless
  </h1>

   It is said that every year the IQ needed to destroy the world drops by one point.
  </p>
  <p>
   Well, yes, but let me add a different spin on the problem:
  </p>
  <p>
   Every year, the IQ needed to make sense of the world raises by one point.
  </p>
  <p>
   If your IQ is 100 and you want to see yourself in 2039 just ask somebody with IQ 80 and listen carefully.

   I know that some people are troubled about prospects of those less intellectually gifted in the modern knowledge-based economy. And yes, it's troubling that we are heading towards some kind of intellectual elitism. But, on the other hand, it may be just a temporary thing. At the end we will all, village idiots and von Neumanns alike, end up having no clue.
  </p>
  <p>
   What are we going to do then?
