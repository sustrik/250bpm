<h1 id="lydiansong">Lydian song</h1>
<p>Now, I know that this is super-weird and probably makes sense to nobody by myself.</p>
<p>First, it's in lydian scale which is nowadays used nowhere but in some Slovak (and, allegedly, also in Polish) folk songs.</p>
<p>Second, the base chord is dissonant (C maj).</p>
<p>It's meant to be played by strings so that dissonances do not fade out.</p>
<p>Use as you see fit.</p>
