# On Becoming Clueless

It is said that every year the IQ needed to destroy the world drops by one point.

Well, yes, but let me add a different spin on the problem:

Every year, the IQ needed to make sense of the world raises by one point.

If your IQ is 100 and you want to see yourself in 2039 just ask somebody with IQ 80 and listen carefully.

I know that some people are troubled about prospects of those less intellectually gifted in the modern knowledge-based economy. And yes, it's troubling that we are heading towards some kind of intellectual elitism. But, on the other hand, it may be just a temporary thing. At the end we will all, village idiots and von Neumanns alike, end up having no clue.

What are we going to do then?
