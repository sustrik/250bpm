# Structured Concurrency Cross-language Forum

There are structured-concurrency-related efforts going on for different programming languages but the entire effort is kind of scattered, without people being aware of each other and speaking to each other.

If we had a common forum, we could share the use cases, the problems, the ideas and the solutions. Each of us, irrespective of which language they are working with, could benefit from this common pool of knowledgeâ€¦

And here we go!

The forum [now exists](https://trio.discourse.group/c/structured-concurrency). Thanks to Nathaniel Smith for setting it up!

And here's my [kick-off post on the forum](https://trio.discourse.group/t/structured-concurrency-kickoff).

Enjoy!
