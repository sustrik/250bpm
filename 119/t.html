<h1 id="documentationdrivendesign">Documentation Driven Design</h1>
<p>After spending full day adding new documentation to libdill and after getting desperate about the repetitivness of the man pages I've got rid of what I had and spent another day writing a program to generate the documentation.</p>
<p>Consider the use cases…</p>
<p>A lot of functions, for example, have deadlines. For each of those functions the man page should contain the following text:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>deadline: A point in time when the operation should time out, in milliseconds. Use the now function to get your current point in time. 0 means immediate timeout, i.e., perform the operation if possible or return without blocking if not. -1 means no deadline, i.e., the call will block forever if the operation cannot be performed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of functions are part of libdill's socket library. Those man pages should state that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This function is not available if libdill is compiled with —disable-sockets option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of functions have a "mem" variant (such as udp_open vs. udp_open_mem) which have almost identical man pages, except for one added paragraph.</p>
<p>Almost all functions have the following piece of text about their return value:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In case of error it returns XXX and sets errno to one of the values below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All functions with deadlines can return ETIMEDOUT error and man pages shoudl say so.</p>
<p>All functions that can possibly use network can return ECONNRESET.</p>
<p>All functions related to a particular network protocol could share a single code example that should be copied into each man page.</p>
<p>And so on and so on.</p>
<p>So I wrote a program to generate all that and the input to that program is a JSON file, a list of all the metadata needed to generate the documentation.</p>
<p>What I've realized in the process was that it forced me think about consitency of libdill's API. If two functions were inconsistent in some way I had to add special case to my documentation generator. That in turn provides an incentive to fix the API and make it more consistent — an incentive that is often missing in the ordinary life of a programmer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I've realized that by writing the metadata JSON file I have unwittingly created a formalized description of some aspects of the library that would, at first sight, seem to be too vague to be formalized. Let me give an example.</p>
<p>Imagine there is a subset of functions that only work if you pray to saint Isidore of Seville, patron saint of programmers. It's pretty hard to express that in a program. However, you still want a line in the man page saying:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The function assumes that the user is praying to St. Isidore during its execution. It the condition is not met the function will exhibit undefined behaviour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be able to generate that line, each function in my JSON metadata file has a field saying "St-Isidore": true.</p>
<p>And it's not only St. Isidore who gets into the play here. Each function could also have metadata describing its dependencies, compile-time options, experimental status, performance characteristics, you name it.</p>
<p>And what's really nice about it is that I have an actual incentive to keep all those metadata in sync with reality, because otherwise my man pages would suck.</p>
<p>And that, of course, makes me wonder: What kind of new applications could we create if we had that kind of rich metadata available in machine-processable format?</p>
