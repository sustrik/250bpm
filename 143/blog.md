# Announcement: A talk about structured concurrency at FOSDEM

Generally, I don't tend to give talks (the last one I gave was six or seven years ago) but this time I am going to make an exception. I am going to give a short talk about structured concurrency as [FOSDEM 2019](https://fosdem.org/2019/).

If you are interested in the topic, meet me in Brussels on February 2nd!

Details about the event can be found [here](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/structured_concurrency/).

If you have no idea what structured concurrency is about, good intro article can be found [here](https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/).

EDIT: The video of the talk can be found [here](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/structured_concurrency/).
