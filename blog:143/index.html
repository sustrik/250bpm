<h1 id="announcementatalkaboutstructuredconcurrencyatfosdem">Announcement: A talk about structured concurrency at FOSDEM</h1>
<p>Generally, I don't tend to give talks (the last one I gave was six or seven years ago) but this time I am going to make an exception. I am going to give a short talk about structured concurrency as <a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/">FOSDEM 2019</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the topic, meet me in Brussels on February 2nd!</p>
<p>Details about the event can be found <a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/structured_concurrency/">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have no idea what structured concurrency is about, good intro article can be found <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/">here</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT: The video of the talk can be found <a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/structured_concurrency/">here</a>.</p>
