<h1 id="programmaticcodegenerationcomposability">Programmatic Code Generation: Composability</h1>
<p>After working some more with <a href="https://github.com/sustrik/tiles">Tiles</a>, my mini-library for programmatic code generation, I've realized it has a feature that I haven't knowingly baked in, but which makes it a really good tool for the job. Namely, the code you write is composable.</p>
<p>Here's what I mean: If you want to generate a C function that prints out names of countries' capitals then you can generate the code that does the actual printing first:</p>
<pre><code>data = {
    "Afghanistan": "Kabul",
    "Brazil": "Brasilia",
    "Canada": "Ottawa",
}

body = t/''
for country, capital in data.items():
    body |= t/"""
              printf("@{capital} is the capital of @{country}");
              """
</code></pre>
<p>Once done, you cen generate the scaffolding:</p>
<pre><code>program = t/"""
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    int main(void) {
        @{body}
        return 0;
    }
    """
</code></pre>
<p>The example, of course, shows just two levels of nesting. In practice, however, you'd have many levels of nesting.</p>
<p>But whatever the nesting level, you, as a programmer, can focus on a single task at a time. First, you think about how to print the capitals. Then you think about the scaffolding. There's no overlap.</p>
<p>Compare that to your typical templating solution:</p>
<pre><code>template = Template("""
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    int main(void) {
        {% for country, capital in data.items() %}
        printf("{{ capital }} is the capital of {{ country }}");
        {% endfor %}
        return 0;
    }
    """)
template.render(data=data)
</code></pre>
<p>Note how you start with writing scaffolding (include, main) then you switch to the business logic (printf), then you get back to scaffolding (return).</p>
<p>The example is trivial and as such, the both solutions are kind of comparable.</p>
<p>However, imagine there are five levels of nesting.</p>
<p>The code written using Tiles would, logically, look like this:</p>
<pre><code>level1
level2
level3
level4
level5
</code></pre>
<p>The code written using one the classic templating tools, on the other hand, would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>level1
  level2
    level3
      level4
        level5
      level4
    level3
  level2
level1
</code></pre>
