<h1 id="equivalenceofstatemachinesandcoroutines">Equivalence of State Machines and Coroutines</h1>
<p>In the past I often referred to the equivalence between state machines and coroutines as a kind of obvious fact that doesn't need any additional explanation. It was brought to my attention, however, that that may not always be the case.</p>
<p>This article therefore doesn't attempt to express and deep and ground-breaking truth, rather, it illustrates the equivalence of state machines and coroutines using a practical example.</p>
<p>The example is stolen from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">Wikipedia's article on finite state machines</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A turnstile, used to control access to subways and amusement park rides, is a gate with three rotating arms at waist height, one across the entryway. Initially the arms are locked, blocking the entry, preventing patrons from passing through. Depositing a coin or token in a slot on the turnstile unlocks the arms, allowing a single customer to push through. After the customer passes through, the arms are locked again until another coin is inserted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia presents the state machine in question in the following manner:</p>

<p>And here's my attempt to rewrite the state machine as a coroutine in Go:</p>
