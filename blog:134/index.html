<p>One day, professor Wheeler from Princeton called Richard Feynman and exclaimed: "Feynman, I know why all electrons have the same charge and the same mass!"</p>
<p>"Why?" asked Feynman.</p>
<p>"Because they are all the same electron, travelling back and forth in time!"</p>
<p>Upon hearing this story, Zarathustra said: "Wheeler was right. Likewise, all the living men are the same man, revived after he dies and carried back in time, for ever and ever, infinitely."</p>
