# One-person Universe

One day, professor Wheeler from Princeton called Richard Feynman and exclaimed: "Feynman, I know why all electrons have the same charge and the same mass!"

"Why?" asked Feynman.

"Because they are all the same electron, travelling back and forth in time!"

Upon hearing this story, Zarathustra said: "Wheeler was right. Likewise, all the living men are the same man, revived after he dies and carried back in time, for ever and ever, infinitely."
