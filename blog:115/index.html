<h1 id="computationalcomplexityasalawofnature">Computational Complexity as a Law of Nature</h1>
<p>I have to admit I know nothing about this topic, however, it is, as far as I can say, one of the weirdest and most interesting recent developments in physics. It is also closely linked to computer science. Yet, I don't see it discussed in programming community at all.</p>
<p>The idea is that, somehow, nature may be fundamentally limited in its computational capacity. That, in other words, it's not possible to compute NP-complete problems in polynomial time and that the hurdle is not some kind of technical problem but rather that uncomputability of such problems is a fundamental principle of physics.</p>
<p>Sounds like a hallucination by a computer science professor? Well, given that an accomplished physicist, such as Leonard Susskind is willing to take it seriously maybe it is not.</p>
<p>And, by the way, if I had to choose between a universe with limited computational power and a universe with limited amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">certainty</a>, the former sounds much less wacky.</p>
<p>In any case, watch the video and wonder: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boZyu6NhAcI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boZyu6NhAcI</a></p>
