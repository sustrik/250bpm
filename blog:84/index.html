<h1 id="thebirch">The Birch</h1>
<p>This is an actual Slovak folk song.</p>
<pre><code>The birch tree is cut down. It's being hauled away.
Yes, it's being hauled away.

The boys won't climb it again.
No, they won't climb it again.

The boys cried. And so did the girls.
Yes, so did the girls.

Because the birch tree is no more.
No, it is no more.
