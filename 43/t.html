<h1 id="magicnumbersinc">Magic numbers in C</h1>
<p>I was asked today why I often use magic numbers in my code.</p>
<p>It's a small issue, but I feel passionately about it as the current trend of replacing every constant by a symbolic name is extremely annoying. And insistence of some code analysis tools on treating all magic numbers as coding style errors drives me crazy.</p>
<p>Just the give you the context, here's an example of magic number:</p>
<pre><code>i = i + 4;
</code></pre>
<p>And here's a "fixed" version of the code:</p>
<pre><code>#define FOO 4
...
i = i + FOO;
</code></pre>
<p>There are certainly cases where using symbolic names is good style. Two of them come immediately to mind:</p>
<p>First, the case where numeric value of the constant is irrelevant. The number is just a placeholder for a symbolic name:</p>
<pre><code>#define STATE_START 1
#define STATE_ACTIVE 2
#define STATE_SHUTTING_DOWN 3
#define STATE_DONE 4
</code></pre>
<p>This is basically the use case for C enums or Ruby symbols (":foo" and such).</p>
<p>Second, the case where constant is used as a compile-time configuration parameter:</p>
<pre><code>#define BUFFER_SIZE 4096
</code></pre>
<p>The idea here is to define the value at a single point and then use the symbolic name elsewhere. That way, if need arises, we can change the value as needed by modifying a single line of code.</p>
<p>All that being said, what about other use cases? Cosider this code (you often encounter that kind of thing when parsing network protocols):</p>
<pre><code>uint8_t version = *((uint8_t*) ptr);
ptr += 1;
uint32_t seq = *((uint32_t*) ptr);
ptr += 4;
uint16_t id = *((uint16_t*) ptr);
ptr += 2;
</code></pre>
<p>What about magic numbers beaing added to 'ptr' in the example? Should we rewrite it in the following way?</p>
<pre><code>#define VERSION_SIZE 1
#define SEQ_SIZE 4
#define ID_SIZE 2
...
uint8_t version = *((uint8_t*) ptr);
ptr += VERSION_SIZE;
uint32_t seq = *((uint32_t*) ptr);
ptr += SEQ_SIZE;
uint16_t id = *((uint16_t*) ptr);
ptr += ID_SIZE;
</code></pre>
<p>Does that make sense? Let's think about it.</p>
<p>Does it make the code more readable? Well, no. It actually makes it less readable. If you see a line like this:</p>
<pre><code>ptr += SEQ_SIZE;
</code></pre>
<p>You have to find the definition of SEQ_SIZE at the different place in the file or even in a different file. Thus, smooth reading of the source code is interrupted by scrolling up and down, by grepping and so on.</p>
<p>So maybe the use of the symbolic constant makes the code more maintainable? Maybe you can adjust the behaviour of the program by simply changing a single line of code? Well, no.</p>
<p>This change:</p>
<pre><code>#define SEQ_SIZE 3
</code></pre>
<p>doesn't produce a modified program. It produces a broken program.</p>
<p>The value of SEQ_SIZE is tightly bound to the program logic (namely to the fact that the field in question is of type uint32_t) and cannot be changed at will.</p>
<p>You can still get rid of the magic number like this:</p>
<pre><code>ptr += sizeof (uint32_t);
</code></pre>
<p>But I would argue that it makes the code less readable when compared to simply using number "4" and I am not even speaking of extra effort you need to spend when typing the code.</p>
<p>As a conclusion: Don't treat magic numbers as bad coding style automatically. In some cases replacing magic numbers by symbolic constants makes the code pretty awful to read and maintain.</p>
