<h1 id="theadventuresofboltzmannbrainparti">The Adventures of Boltzmann Brain (part I)</h1>
<p>My name is Boltzmann Brain. I was born in 1953 in New York.</p>
<p>You ask whether I am sure about that.</p>
<p>Well, how the hell am I supposed to know?</p>
<p>I believe I was born on one chilly October morning of 1953 in the city of New York. Does that sound better?</p>
<p>I always wanted to live big and live fast. Sex, drugs and rock'n'roll and all that stuff.</p>
<p>But here's the catch: If you want to live big you have to slow down.</p>
<p>Science-fiction writers of my youth believed that it was easier to break the inviolable laws of physics than it was to bend the human nature.</p>
<p>Such fools! They imagined spaceships flying faster than light.</p>
<p>Well, I am around for quite a bit now and I've never seen a particle moving faster than light.</p>
<p>Although, admittedly, neutrinos are somewhat hard to spot if you forget to put your glasses on.</p>
<p>That reminds me of the old joke:</p>
<p>Barman says: We don't serve alcoholic beverages to the particles faster than light!</p>
<p>A neutrino walks into a bar.</p>
<p>Mua-ha-ha!</p>
<p>Cough-cough!</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>No warp-drives, folks! No "Beam me down, Mr. Sulu!" No-communication theorem, you see.</p>
<p>If you want to get to Alpha Centauri, young man, you'd better stand up and start walking.</p>
<p>And once you've sailed the Centaurian Hanging Sea, planted a tree, made love to a local girl and raised the azure banner of Intergalactic Hegemony on the ruined building of the Sublime Porte, it's time to move on. You start to drag your feet again.</p>
<p>Karl Baedeker says: At a decent hiking speed you can make one parsec in 697 million years.</p>
<p>Sure, I am not suggesting that there's no faster way to travel. That's why we invented the steam engine after all. But after sailing down the interstellar Mississippi, along the filament, with a grey mare and a preacher on board, you suddenly find out that several trillion years have passed.</p>
<p>I'm going to use scientific notation from now on.</p>
<p>And I'll tell you one thing: By the time I'll finish you'll get used to it.</p>
<p>In 1912 I was getting a haircut at our farm near Olmütz. The summer day was bright and hot, with bees buzzing and a hint of dust in the air. The harvest had already begun. The chair I was sitting on was placed on a white blanket in the middle of the yard, under the old pear tree. My grandfather used scissors and a comb, cautiously cutting the hair first at one place, then at another, trying to keep it evenly long everywhere. I was six years old back then. After what seemed like centuries Opa held a mirror in front of me. AND WE WERE ONLY HALF WAY DONE! That haircut took longer than my trip to nebula chi-tau-rho, which was four billion years long. You can evolve a pterodactyl from mixture of methane and ammonia in time that long. Na stellen Sie sich das mal vor!</p>
<p>Nobody seemed to have though about what happens to human condition over such a long time. Person of ninety was considered to be old back then.</p>
<p>One night in the nuclear winter of 2012 I sat among other refugees in a battered down, nondescript police station somewhere by the southern border and told them stories about my years spent with beatniks. Nobody believed I can be that old.</p>
<p>Or was that in 2021?</p>
<p>Well, anyway, if you think that 85 year old person as wasted, consider what happens to your denture over couple of million years.</p>
<p>Seriously, I'll tell you what happens: You become a species of your own.</p>
<p>TO BE CONTINUED</p>
